<div class="laugh_big_title">Two Passover Jokes</div>

<div class="column1">


<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong> I. </strong></em></p>
<p><em>Bill O'Brien, a blind scholar, is invited to his first seder at his colleague and friend Sam Brodsky's house. All goes smoothly until a matzo is set on his plate. O'Brien passes his hand lightly across it and asks, "Who wrote this crap?"</em></p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>II.</strong></em></p>

<p><em>Arthur Miller takes his new wife Marilyn Monroe to his mother's apartment for her first seder. On the way home, Miller asks Marilyn if she enjoyed it.</em></p>


<p><em>"Darling, I loved it all," she says, "all your family together, the ritual, the prayers, the food—especially
the food."</em></p>

</div>

<div class="column2">
<p><em>"I'm delighted," says Miller, "but tell me, sweetheart, what dish did you like best?"</em></p>


<p><em>"I loved your mother's chicken soup," Marilyn says. "So clear, so golden, so flavorful."</em></p>


<p><em>"And the matzo balls?" he asks. "What did you think of my mother's matzo balls?"</em></p>


<p><em>"Oh, Arthur, I especially loved those matzo balls. How ever did your mother get them to be so light, so perfectly round, so tasty? They were absolutely scrumptious."</em></p></div>
</div>

<div class="page last">
<div class="column1">

<p><em>"My mother will be pleased to hear it," Miller says.</em></p>


<p><em>"In fact, I'll write your mother a note tomorrow about her fabulous matzo balls. I just loved those matzo balls to death. But tell me, Arthur, what do you Jews do with the rest of the matzo?"</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Winning Exegesis of "</strong><strong>Two Passover Jokes</strong><strong>" ...</strong></p>
<strong>...comes from Shmuel Stein, of Lakewood, New Jersey, who writes:</strong> For a non-Jew trying to gain an understanding of Judaism, matzo is quite perplexing. During what is arguably the most important holiday of the year, at which time the Jews celebrate, among other things, becoming a nation, the most important service performed is to eat a cracker. Immediately the onlooker's mind starts racing. What can the secret hidden quality of the matzo be? Is there something special about its grooves and holes? Is there more to the matzo than we bring to the table?</p></div>
<div class="column2">

<p>The joke is, there isn't. The Talmud refers to matzo as the "poor mans bread." Nothing fancy, just bread and water that was not even given the chance to rise. The Jew's uniqueness is rooted in his harrowing past of persecution, torment, and destruction. His hardship is also reason for celebration—for that is what has made him a Jew.</p>
