<p class='letters_p'><em>To the Editor:</em><br/>
<p>Daniel DiSalvo, in his thoughtful article “The Reformist Right and the Reactionary Left” [April], points out many ways in which the left and right have switched sides. He informs us that conservatives “need to manage strong antigovernment forces within their ranks.” I am reminded of former Arkansas representative Jay Dickey, a Republican, who told the <em>New York Times</em>, “We have the right to bear arms because of the threat of government taking over the freedoms that we have.” He sounds not unlike the Weather Underground of the late 1960s and early 1970s. President Ronald Reagan, on the other hand, supported the Brady Act, saying, “It’s just plain commonsense that there be a waiting period to allow local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks on those wishing to buy a handgun.”</p>

<p>Nowadays, Democrats often praise President George H.?W. Bush, who created a coalition of 32 nations to fight Saddam Hussein and then ended the war suddenly, allowing Saddam to slaughter Kurds in northern Iraq and marsh Arabs in the south. The war began, apparently, when Ambassador April Glaspie told Saddam that it was acceptable for him to invade Kuwait. He promptly did. Did Bush 41 know what Glaspie had said? If not, why not? Be that as it may, Democrats admire G.?H.?W. Bush. Has anybody ever interviewed April Glaspie? She must still be alive.</p>

<p>Democrats most certainly do not admire G.?W. Bush, who tried to make the world safe for democracy. Does anybody remember that it was Democratic President Woodrow Wilson who talked about making the world safe for democracy?</p>

<p>The <em>New York Times</em> endorsed Republican candidates Wendell Willkie for president in 1940, Thomas Dewey in 1948, and Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956. During World War II, the Times buried information about the Holocaust. Today the Times is unambiguously for the Democratic Party. It also buried the statement by Hezbollah leader Sheik Hassan Nasrallah reported in the Lebanon Daily Star on October 23, 2002: “If they [Jews] all gather in Israel, it will save us the trouble of going after them worldwide.” Left and right have switched, just as Daniel DiSalvo told us, but other things have remained the same.</p>

<p><em>Daniel DiSalvo writes:</em></p>

<p>George Jochnowitz’s letter is a helpful reminder that although the left and right have recently switched positions in their attitudes toward reform and change of the welfare state, many things have remained the same. Indeed, in modern political life there have been and will continue to be many occasions when the far left and far right, despite starting from different premises, arrive at the same point. As the French say, les extrèmes se touchent. Unfortunately, armed militant antigovernment groups persist on the fringes of American life. In the 1960s, these groups came from the left of the political spectrum. Today, some evidently come from the right. The impulse for both movements comes, in part, from a desire for individual liberation from the constraints of government and society. Freeing individuals from the confines of social tradition and religious authority to pursue happiness as they see fit has many benefits, but also a dark side that can come in many forms. Sadly, we have probably not seen the last of this desire.</p>

<p>Mr. Jochnowitz also notes another persistent phenomenon in political life: the propensity to argue in bad faith. The examples are rich and plentiful. For better or worse, however, this is something that is inherent in political life and will be with us forever.</p>

<p>All that said, rather than discuss the many relative constants in modern politics, my essay had the more modest purpose of showing how the current age of <p>austerity has driven the left and right in contemporary Western democracies to alter their attitudes toward the future. The left now wants a future more like the past, and the right champions policy experimentation. It’s a topsy-turvy world!</p>
