<p> his compatriots beyond the failed ideologies that had defined Lebanon for more than a generation. But rather than cower in fear and submit, a majority of the Lebanese—usually notorious for their sectarian fractiousness—united around the March 14 movement, calling for political freedom and the withdrawal of Syria’s occupation force from their country.</p><p>In <em>The Road to Fatima Gate</em>, Michael J. Totten offers a masterful account of this Cedar Revolution, as it came to be known, and its tragic aftermath. Totten, a frequent contributor to Commentary’s blog, practices journalism in the tradition of George Orwell: morally imaginative, partisan in the best sense of the word, and delivered in crackling, rapid-fire prose befitting the violent realities it depicts. An unabashed classical liberal, Totten brings his political commitments and emotional intelligence to bear on the dramatic events he witnesses. As</p></div>

<p> a result, he ends up far more clear-sighted than the many analysts who claim objectivity but share neither his love of the region and its inhabitants nor his concern for its future. Totten’s Lebanon is a Mideast crucible, foretelling the promise—and peril—of the democratic uprisings that would rock the region in 2009 and then again last winter.
</p><p>First, the promise. In Lebanon, it was represented by more than one million people who—in what was then an unprecedented sight in the Arab world—peacefully took to the streets of Beirut in response to Hariri’s assassination. Beyond their specific demands, the young leaders of the March 14 movement were determined to radically alter the very nature of Lebanese politics. “We want to rebuild our country,” one tells Totten. “And that includes rebuilding our minds. Lebanon has been so divided. We stand not only for freedom and independence, but also national unity and a new, modern, common, tolerant Lebanese identity.” The March 14ers, in other words, rejected the politics of existential negation and permanent enmity that had deformed a once pluralistic Lebanon. On March 14, the rebirth against all odds of <em>that</em> Lebanon seemed both imminent and inevitable.</p>
<p>The promise was also represented by an older generation of sectarian leaders willing to bury the hatchets they had wielded during Lebanon’s civil war. The most striking of these transformations was undoubtedly the one undergone by Samir Geagea, the leader of the once brutal Maronite militia known as the Lebanese Forces. When the Syrians departed, Geagea emerged from solitary</p></div>

<div class="column2"><p> confinement, where he had spent more than a decade after being convicted of bogus charges relating to his civil war–era activities. (His hands were not clean by any measure, but unlike other communal leaders, Geagea was refused amnesty for failing to fully cooperate with Syrian overlordship in post–civil war Lebanon.) While in jail, Geagea had spent countless hours discovering religious mysticism. Once free, he embraced the March 14 spirit of coexistence rather than seek revenge. “He sounded like a Taoist,” Totten concludes after meeting Geagea. “The mystic in his bunker might make an excellent companion to be stuck with in a foxhole, but he had no intention of digging one ever again.” Leaders of Lebanon’s Sunni and Druze communities, Totten shows, underwent similar transformations.</p>
<p>The remarkable realignment of political attitudes among Lebanon’s sectarian elites could not be credited solely to March 14’s moral accomplishments. It also reflected a long-term shift in the balance of power in Lebanese society—and the growing menace of the Iranian-backed Shia terrorist organization Hezbollah. Most of Totten’s narrative is devoted to explaining how the Iranian theocrats and their Syrian sidekicks managed in just a few years to recapture Beirut, reverse the gains of the March 14 coalition, and route its leaders.</p>
<p>And herein lies the peril. For, amid all the post-ideological and post-sectarian euphoria, it was easy to forget that the heterodox life-world of the March 14ers exists side by side with another, wholly</p>

<p> different one: the militarized state-within-a-state ruled by the Party of God, where the regular armed forces—let alone most Western journalists—dare not tread. Totten, though, makes his way into Hezbollah’s squalid, backward stronghold in the <em>dahiyeh</em> (suburb) of Haret Hreik, among other Hezbollah-controlled areas. What he finds “looked, alternately, like a slum of Tehran or Damascus.” The comparison is apt in more ways than one. While technically located within Lebanon’s borders, “Hezbollahland,” as Totten calls it, is really a satellite of the ayatollahs’ Shia empire. Here, Lebanese Shia are kept dependent on Hezbollah’s welfare system, force-fed a steady diet of anti-American and anti-Semitic propaganda, and taught to seek “martyrdom” rather than help rebuild Lebanon.</p><p>“This isn’t my country,” one of Totten’s guides in the <em>dahiyeh</em> tells him. It is a painful realization. “Many Hezbollah dependents thought of themselves,” Totten explains, “as part of a transnational sectarian community with Tehran as its capital rather than a multi-sectarian nation-state with Beirut as its capital.” Many Tehranis, of course, would less than politely decline the invitation to subsume their beloved city to the Shia super-state—that is, if they had a choice about the matter; most Iranians, like their Lebanese counterparts, live under a state of internal occupation.</p>
<p>In Lebanon, the sense that one life-world is slowly suffocating another is most palpable not in the southern <em>dahiyehs</em>, but precisely where the two overlap in Beirut. Totten encounters this strange phenomenon </p></div>

<div class="column2"><p>firsthand when he attends an <em>iftar</em>, featuring Sheik Nasrallah himself, at the invitation of Hezbollah’s then newly established “media relations” department. The event takes place just across the street from the Beirut Marriott, but it may as well have been held in a <em>basij</em> outpost on the outskirts of Tehran. As the <em>iftar</em> comes to a close, Totten and a photographer accompanying him are briefly detained and manhandled by Hezbollah security operatives, whose paranoia is apparently triggered by the photographer’s middle name, Isaac. The encounter reveals a surreal, alternate dimension: a totalitarian polity existing within an open, cosmopolitan city. “Inside was Hezbollah’s mini police state,” Totten recalls. “Outside was free Lebanon."</p>
<p>Chilling as it must surely have been in real time, the episode makes for one of the funnier passages in the book. But the mullahs’ foothold in the Levant is no laughing matter. It allows them to wage jihad against Israel at minimal cost to the Islamic Republic. As Totten learns, Hezbollah’s method of launching thousands of blind rockets at Israeli border towns, while cheap and crude, is nevertheless unimaginably cruel. Indeed, the most terrifying firsthand experience he relates is of covering northern Israel during Hezbollah’s rocket campaign. “When you’re under fire from above,” he writes, “the sky feels like a gigantic malevolent eyeball.” The likelihood of any single Katyusha rocket finding a living target is low, but the psychological terror wrought exacts a heavy toll against civilians. Of course, when Israel retaliates, as it did in the July 2006 war,</p></div>

<p> Lebanon foots the bill for Iranian aggression and adventurism.</p>
<p>Israel’s 2006 excursion into Lebanon produced, at best, mixed results. The IDF rattled Hezbollah’s leadership, but failed to fully dismantle the organization’s terror infrastructure. As soon as hostilities ceased, Iran began replenishing Hezbollah’s rocket stockpiles. Then, in 2008, a cornered Hezbollah lashed out northward, placing the March 14 movement in its crosshairs. Nasrallah sought to accomplish by brute force what he could not in the realm of consensual politics, and he succeeded. Hezbollah snipers—aided by the fascist thugs of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party—conquered Beirut once more. In the process, they permanently disrupted Lebanon’s carefully balanced sectarian power-sharing structure.</p>

<p>Once the dust settled, Totten writes, “the ground no longer felt stable.” The spiritual scars Hezbollah left behind were deeper than the physical ones. The Lebanese people returned to their paranoid, divided status quo ante. After Hezbollah’s coup, Charles Chuman, a Lebanese-American friend of Totten’s tells him, “People I knew...stopped looking at me as a person. I became a political position in human form. They stopped thinking of me as Charles and could only see me as a function of politics. And they took up arms against me. Instantly.” The colorful Beirut spring thus turned into the dark winter of the sectarian fanatic.</p></div>

<div class="column2"><p>Totten frequently quotes the Druze warlord Walid Jumblatt to the effect that the solution to his country’s troubles lies in Tehran. It is appropriate, then, that Totten’s narrative of modern Lebanon’s failed quest for freedom should end not in Beirut, but in the Persian capital. In 2009, the angel of history seemed poised to vindicate Beirut’s defeated liberals in Tehran, the very heart of the Shia empire of “resistance.” Alas, the angel’s vengeful wrath could not overcome the mullahs’ limitless brutality. Yet the spirit of the Beirut spring would not be vanquished by the most repressive regime in the world’s least free region. Last winter, it took flight from Tehran to Sidi Bouzid, Tunisia, where the self-immolation of a fruit vendor led to the fall of a rotten autocracy. From there, it traveled to Cairo, Benghazi, Manama, Sanaa, Daraa, and so on.</p>
<p>The outcome of each of these uprisings hangs in the balance; each can serve to unleash the Mideast’s human potential, or end up erecting yet another prison-state. The lesson of the Beirut spring for each of their protagonists—and for us—is this: freedom may be the natural state of man, but its future in the Middle East is neither guaranteed nor immune from the region’s underlying geopolitical realities. It is never enough, then, for liberals to merely compose manifestos with beautiful watchwords like “compromise” and “consent”—when their opponents write theirs in blood.</p>
