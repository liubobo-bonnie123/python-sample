So small was Boiberik that the only eligible bachelor was the town butcher. After being married to a scholarly rabbi, marriage to a butcher was a comedown, but the widow, in her loneliness, nonetheless agreed.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The first Friday after the marriage, upon returning from the <em>mikvah</em>, the former <em>rebbetzin</em> was preparing to light the candles when her new husband leaned over to say, “My mother, Hannah, of blessed memory, used to say that after the <em>mikvah</em> and before lighting the candles, it is life-affirming to make love.” And so they did.</p><p style="text-align: left;">After the evening meal, the butcher says to his wife, “My father, Shmuel, an honorable man, instructed me that making love is a fine way of greeting the sabbath.” So off they went to the bedroom.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The next morning, upon waking, the butcher says to his new wife, “My grandmother, Rivka, a sweet soul, always claimed that it is sensible to make love before going to synagogue, the better to clear your mind for prayer.” And so they do.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Upon their return home, settled on their couch, the butcher says to his wife: “My grandfather, Moishe, not a learned but a faultlessly devout man, held that making love after a morning of prayer is the best of all possible ways to begin the new week.” And so once again they repair to the bedroom.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The next day, at market, the former <em>rebbetzin</em> meets her friend Tema-Gittel, who asks, “So how is the new husband?”“Well,” replies the former <em>rebbetzin</em>, “a scholar he isn’t, but he comes from a wonderful family.”</p><p style="text-align: center;">_____________</p><p style="text-align: center;">Now here’s the joke that ran in our April issue.</p><p style="text-align: center;">_____________</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Two Passover Jokes</strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em><strong> I. </strong></em></p><p><em>Bill O’Brien, a blind scholar, is invited to his first seder at his colleague and friend Sam Brodsky’s house.

On the way home, Miller asks Marilyn if she enjoyed it.</em></p><p><em>“Darling, I loved it all,” she says, “all your family together, the ritual, the prayers, the food—especiallythe food.”</em></p><p><em>“I’m delighted,” says Miller, “but tell me, sweetheart, what dish did you like best?”</em></p><p><em>“I loved your mother’s chicken soup,” Marilyn says. “So clear, so golden, so flavorful.”</em></p><p><em>“And the matzo balls?” he asks. “What did you think of my mother’s matzo balls?”</em></p><p><em>“Oh, Arthur, I especially loved those matzo balls. How ever did your mother get them to be so light, so perfectly round, so tasty? They were absolutely scrumptious.”</em></p><p><em>“My mother will be pleased to hear it,” Miller says.</em></p><p><em>“In fact, I’ll write your mother a note tomorrow about her fabulous matzo balls. I just loved those matzo balls to death. But tell me, Arthur, what do you Jews do with the rest of the matzo?”</em></p><p style="text-align: center;"><em> </em>_____________</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Winning Exegesis of "</strong><strong>Two Passover Jokes</strong><strong>" ...</strong></p><strong>...comes from Shmuel Stein, of Lakewood, New Jersey, who writes:</strong> For a non-Jew trying to gain an understanding of Judaism, matzo is quite perplexing. During what is arguably the most important holiday of the year, at which time the Jews celebrate, among other things, becoming a nation, the most important service performed is to eat a cracker. Immediately the onlooker’s mind starts racing. What can the secret hidden quality of the matzo be? Is there something special about its grooves and holes? Is there more to the matzo than we bring to the table?</p><p>The joke is, there isn’t. The Talmud refers to matzo as the “poor mans bread.” Nothing fancy, just bread and water that was not even given the chance to rise. The Jew’s uniqueness is rooted in his harrowing past of persecution, torment, and destruction. His hardship is also reason for celebration—for that is what has made him a Jew.</p><p style="text-align: center;">_____________</p><p style="text-align: center;">Again, please e-mail your exegeses of “The Rabbi’s Widow Joke” (250 words or fewer) to: enterlaughing@commentarymagazine.com.
