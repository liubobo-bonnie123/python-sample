I was 32 when it fell. My generation, the Berlin Wall generation, was not the first to be formed by the uncanny circumstances of the Cold War. The first was that of my parents who had already survived the Second World War. To most of that generation, the division of Europe into Soviet and Western spheres of influence seemed a price worth paying for peace. Indeed, the new threat of nuclear war, with the prospect of destruction on a scale even more terrible than that endured by their grandparents in World War I and their parents in World War II, was enough to attract many of them to join protests that eventually grew into the “peace movement” that lasted until the end of the Cold War.</p><div class="comment">

<div class="column2"><p>In due course, my own generation was shaped by the attitudes of our elders. Many of us adopted their causes, from opposition to the Vietnam War in the 1960s to opposition to the medium-range cruise and Pershing missiles whose placement in Europe in the 1980s led to demonstrations that dwarfed anything seen during the protests against the invasion of Iraq. Hardly a moment’s thought was given to the hundred million or more East Europeans who had paid for our peace and prosperity with their liberty and poverty. The “People’s Republics” of the Eastern bloc were actually peopled with hostages: even those who had the opportunity to emigrate to the West dared not flee for fear of the consequences for their families and friends.</p><p>I was the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>’s correspondent in Eastern Europe in 1989 when, with the same kind of speed we saw in the collapse of Egypt, East Germany began to crumble. At a press conference on November 9, 1989, when the easing of travel restrictions on East Germans was announced, it fell to me to ask the final question: “What will happen to the Berlin Wall now?” This was the first</p></div>

<p> time the wall itself had been mentioned in the press conference, and I remain astonished and proud that my eight words seemed to encourage the watching East Berliners to go out and demand to be allowed to pass through. Three days later, they began chipping at the wall with pickaxes as the guards who had kept them in bondage for nearly three decades watched, powerless and unwilling to intervene.</p><p>Who, though, was to blame for the fact that the suffering populace of East Germany had languished behind it for 28 years? After all, in the decade or so before the Berlin Wall was built, some two million East Germans emigrated to the West. Many more had been able to leave from the other Eastern bloc countries. Those who remained behind did so in part because, encouraged by broadcasts from the BBC, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, they hoped and believed that the West would not abandon them. The shocking conclusion of Frederick Kempe’s new book, <em>Berlin 1961</em>, is that responsibility for the fate of Eastern Europe lies with the president many Americans still revere as the man who saved them from nuclear war: John F. Kennedy.</p><p>Kempe knows a great deal about Berlin. His connections began in his mother’s womb: she was a Berliner who, like his father, emigrated from Germany and after the war sent care packages to relations in the East. Later, Kempe reported from the city for the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, where he worked as a foreign correspondent, columnist, and editor for a quarter century. He is the best kind of old-fashioned journalist who makes sure to</p></div>

<div class="column2">
<p> tell readers all they need to know, but never too much. As its title suggests, <em>Berlin 1961 </em>focuses on the city that was the only stage where the two superpowers confronted each other directly, but Kempe’s camera pans rapidly across to Washington, Moscow, Vienna, and the other theaters of the Cold War. The day-by-day, sometimes hour-by-hour account of how Kennedy and his circle of advisers handled the crisis of 1961 is surprisingly fresh, given the quantities of ink already spilled on this briefest of presidencies.</p><p>This is not one of those books about Kennedy that dwells in prurient detail on his private life but has nothing to say about his public life: instead, the former is firmly subordinated to the latter. Thus in Kempe’s description of the first Kennedy-Khrushchev encounter at the Vienna summit in June 1961, we learn much about the psychological effects of Kennedy’s ailments and medication, but only to explain how the youthful president was worn down and outmaneuvered by the aggressive tactics employed by Khrushchev. Likewise, the lack of personal chemistry between Kennedy and the octogenarian West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer would not have mattered, except that it caused the president to discount the chancellor’s pleas for German unity as a long-term goal and instead to complain about the cost of maintaining U.S. troops in West Germany. Fearing the danger of an accidental escalation to nuclear conflict, Kennedy had privately resolved there was no point in maintaining the fiction that he could prevent the Russians from building a wall to halt the exodus from East</p></div>

<div class="page">
<div class="column1">
<p> Berlin. That decision had momentous consequences for Europe, not least for Adenauer’s policy of refusing all dealings with East Germany. His younger rival Willy Brandt (whom Kennedy much preferred) would later pursue the now notorious policy of <em>Ostpolitik</em> in order to come to a mutually profitable arrangement with the Eastern bloc that froze the borders until 1989.</p>

<p>In spite of his attention to the foibles of the leaders, Kempe never loses sight of the bigger picture. He deploys his reporter’s vox pop technique to remind the reader of the impact of high diplomacy on lesser mortals. He tells the story of Günter Litfin, the first person to be shot and killed trying to escape East Berlin a few days after the border was closed on August 13—the first of hundreds to die at the wall over the next 28 years. But Kempe also tells the less tragic tale of Marlene Schmidt, the engineer who fled the East in 1960 and became West Germany’s first and only Miss Universe in 1961. Her celebrity was an acute embarrassment for the East German strongman Walter Ulbricht. His propagandists fulminated that whereas East Germans valued Marlene for her skills as an engineer, in America these were ignored: “Now all that matters are her bust, butt, and hips. She is no longer to be taken seriously.”</p><p>The overarching thesis of the book, however, is that Kennedy allowed Khrushchev to get away with turning East Germany into a gigantic jailhouse. Kempe argues that Kennedy proved so inept in his first few months as president that Khrushchev gave Ulbricht the go-ahead to build the Wall,</p></div>

<p> thereby breaking the terms of the agreement between the wartime Allies that still governed Berlin. In speeches and other signals, Kennedy had hinted that he cared about the security of West Berlin but was not prepared to defend the right of free passage through Checkpoint Charlie.</p>

<p>The attempt to force such free passage by the use of tanks was made in October 1961 by U.S. General Lucius Clay. His tank formation was met near Checkpoint Charlie by an equal number of Soviet tanks, unmarked to allow for the possibility of retreat. Clay was determined to knock down the still rudimentary wall with bulldozer-mounted tanks. His counterpart, Marshal Konev, knew about Clay’s plans and feared war. World War III was postponed, however, when Kennedy’s secretary of state, Dean Rusk, ordered Clay to sound the retreat. Through his brother Bobby, President Kennedy had sent the Kremlin a message: pull out your tanks and we won’t touch the wall.</p><p>This marked a historic shift in U.S. policy that allowed the Soviet Union a free hand in Eastern Europe. Only after the confrontation at Checkpoint Charlie did Kennedy realize that, next time, he would have to call Khrushchev’s bluff, and he did so effectively the following year during the Cuban missile crisis. In June 1963, he would travel to Berlin for what may have been his greatest triumph as president: the speech he gave there in front of an ecstatic mob in which he nobly declaimed: “All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin and, therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the</p></div>

<p> words, ‘<em>Ich</em> <em>bin ein Berliner</em>.’” With his untimely death, however, Kennedy bequeathed his country and the world two fatal legacies: the Vietnam War and the Berlin Wall.</p>
