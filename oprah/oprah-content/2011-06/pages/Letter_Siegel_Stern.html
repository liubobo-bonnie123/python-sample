<span class="letters_dropfirst">I</span><span class="lead_text1">n</span> “The Bloomberg Bubble Bursts” [March], Fred Siegel and Sol Stern claim that teachers’ salary increases came with almost no return effort on the teachers’ part. This is biased writing. In order to earn a salary increase, teachers had to work an additional 150 minutes per week. This was therefore not a salary increase at all, but additional pay for additional work.</p>

<span class="letters_dropfirst">M</span><span class="lead_text1">ayor</span> Michael Bloomberg will go down in history as one of New York City’s worst mayors. Fred Siegel and Sol Stern do not even mention Bloomberg’s “Rubber Room” policy, his preferred method for getting senior teachers off school payrolls and on the road to termination. Bloomberg has destroyed the city’s education system. All one needs do is ask a teacher. Morale is poor, children are treated as robots, and the joy of teaching has disappeared. Teachers are leaving the system in droves. That’s what I did, after working for 27 years. I left a system that would rather push out experienced, dedicated professionals than reward them as top earners. Mayor Bloomberg is not an</p>

<span class="letters_dropfirst">F</span><span class="lead_text1">red</span> Siegel and Sol Stern’s excellent article should be distributed through every major media outlet in the region. Why can’t Mayor Bloomberg be impeached? I am an educator of 20 years and understand firsthand how his reforms have destroyed the education of millions of children. Worst of all, special-needs children are being bombarded with material they can’t master.</p>

<p class='letters_indent'>I can’t wrap my brain around the legally questionable things Bloomberg gets away with.</p>

<span class="letters_dropfirst">T</span><span class="lead_text1">he</span> Bloomberg Bubble Bursts” is a fine, well-researched piece. However, Siegel and Stern omit, for some reason, what many New Yorkers consider one of Mayor Bloomberg’s most incomprehensible actions: his decision to support the very unpopular plan for the construction of the Park51 project near Ground Zero.</p>

<p class='letters_p'><em>To the Editor:</em><br/>
<span class="letters_dropfirst">T</span><span class="lead_text1">hank</span> you for Fred Siegel and Sol Stern’s hard look at Mayor Bloomberg and his cohorts. The damage they have done and will do is almost medieval in scope: scores of small businesses have closed; real-estate prices have reached absurd levels; onerous and arbitrary regulation and enforcement have created a fearsome business climate; and people have actually died because of his incompetence and arrogance. But, then, they were in the outer boroughs. Little people be damned.</p>
<p class='letters_indent'>New York is now a city where police officers cite business owners when someone drops a cigarette on the sidewalk and yet supermarkets routinely ignore basic consumer protections. Building owners are taking Bloomberg’s hints to go upscale by driving out long-established businesses with astronomical rent increases. Staten Island alone could lose thousands of jobs if the mayor’s plan to build a pedestrian promenade on the waterfront forces companies out.</p>

<span class="letters_dropfirst">O</span><span class="lead_text1">ur</span> correspondents seem to think we weren't harsh enough on Mayor Bloomberg and that we neglected particular items that concerned them, such as Bloomberg's position on the Park51 project and rent increases on small businesses.

<p class='letters_p'> course, couldn’t cover every governance issue arising during the nine years of the Bloomberg administration. Instead, we provided an overview of the main policies that brought about Bloomberg’s reversal of fortune.</p>

<p class='letters_indent'>Several writers say that we didn’t point out how mean the mayor has been to the city’s teachers. Actually, we believe that Mayor Bloomberg wasn’t tough enough with the teachers’ union on work rules and the irrational pay scales mandated by the labor contract. Yelena Siwinski thinks that the 150 minutes per week that teachers are now required to work justifies an across-the-board salary increase of 43 percent. We hope she’s not a math teacher. Over the 36-week teacher work year, that extra 150 minutes per week adds up to an extra 90 hours of work. The 43 percent salary increase gave the most experienced teachers a raise of $30,000 per year. Teachers who think this is a fair trade-off are even more delusional than we thought.</p>
