City of Culture of Galicia Archive and Library
Eisenman Architects
Santiago de Compostela, Spain

Visitors park at the east end of the complex, and enter on the red granite and asphalt paths that cleave the archive and the library. The rose and tan quartzite stone surfacing the roof is supported by steel scaffolding above a secondary roof of concrete with waterproofing and insulation.
