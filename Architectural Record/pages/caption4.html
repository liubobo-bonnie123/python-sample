City of Culture of Galicia Archive and Library
Eisenman Architects
Santiago de Compostela, Spain

Jagged mullions along the south elevation of the archive building frame gray-tinted glass while a white aluminum channel breaks the surface. At the southwest corner are the John Hejduk Towers, originally projected for a site in Santiago de Compostela, but unrealized, and so erected here at Eisenman&rsquo;s suggestion.
